The Teensey3 has a 9DOF shield that can be used in conjunction with the uDSKY.  
The following files are PROCESSING sketches that can be used to visulize the
Apollo spacecraft and the FDAI indicator. This is a work in progress.  It will need
the additional hardware and to tie the DSKY firmware to these. Currently they
are just mouse controlled.  The COM Port may need to be changed to match.
