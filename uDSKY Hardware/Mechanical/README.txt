These are the files i used to make the plates to hold the miniDSKY boards. 

I cannont say if these file will manufacture the plexi and plastic sheets 
because i just printed these out and used as a guide for drilling.

I changed the keys th the Sparkfun MX breakout board, this is .75" sq and
fits nicely into the scale. I used releagenable keys that put the printed
key caps.  The MX keys have a nice feel and can be back lit. They are attached
with small rolling plastic screws.  I will put the parts list in later.

The boards are stacked with some spacers and it sandwiches together so the
stack is fairly sturdy. 

The indicators were 1000mdc white and yellow LEDs on a perf board.

I will put the lables in PDF or another printable form.

One more board needs to be added.  I did not put mounting holes.  This is the
power supply module.  It takes in 12VDC and provides a +5V for the boards. The
12V is also run thru some opto-isolators to control 12V to the large LEDs and 
key backlights. This will be controlled thu one of the DP lines.

Three types of plastic sheets are used:

.125" Black Matt sheets (F45 I think)  these should hold paint well too

.125 50% matt white (for indicators)

The final plate is a clear plexiglas that cover the display openings and protect
the paper labels. It is a little tricky as there are some holes only part way thru.
